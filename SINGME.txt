The Drupal issue queues
(To the tune of Hotel California, by Larry Garfield)

On a warm summer evening, cool wind in my hair
Warm glow from my laptop, X X X X X X
But then there in my browser, I saw a int'resting sight
T'was a CMS made with PHP
I had to check out this the site
There they sat in the channel
Helping newbies to code
I was thinking to myself,
'This thing called Drupal is all full of nodes?'
Then she sent me a PM and she showed me the way
There were people there in IRC,
I thought I saw them say...

'Welcome to the Drupal issue queues'
'Such a lovely place' (such a lovely place)
'Includes Cathy Theys'
'There's plenty of threads in the Drupal issue queues'
'Any time of night' (any time of night)
'You can code it right'

The code was certainly twisted
It was all based on arrays
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends
How they dance at the conference, sweet geeky sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I pinged the Committers, 'Please review my patch'
Dries said, 'This affects performance you need to go talk to catch'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...

'Welcome to the Drupal issue queues'
'Such a lovely patch' (such a lovely patch)
'Got reviewed by catch'
They living it up in the Drupal issue queues
What a nice surprise! (what a nice surprise! )
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't pass the 'bot
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man, 'We are programed to receive'
'You can reroll any time you like, but you can never leave'
